# zomato-pune-analysis
Analysis of restaurants in Pune as per the data on the Zomato Pune website.
<br>
This repo contains all the analysis I have done on the dataset given by the PISB DataWiz Team for the second task of DataWiz 2k21.
For this task, we had to implement at least 5 unique types of data visualisations, based on whatever correlations we felt are apt.
<br>
General Procedure to follow:
1) Perform data preparation & cleaning
  - Handle missing, incorrect and invalid data (if any)
  - Perform any additional steps (creating additional columns, merging multiple columns etc. if needed)

2) Perform exploratory analysis & visualization
  - Compute the mean, sum, range and other interesting statistics for numeric columns
  - Explore distributions of numeric columns using histograms etc.
  - Explore relationship between columns using scatter plots, bar charts etc.
  - Make a note of interesting insights from the exploratory analysis

3) Ask & answer questions about the data
- Ask at least 5 interesting questions about your dataset
- Answer the questions either by computing the results using Numpy/Pandas or by plotting graphs using Matplotlib/Seaborn

4) Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion
- Write a summary of what you've learned from the analysis
- Include interesting insights and graphs from previous sections
