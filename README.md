Analysis of restaurants in Pune as per the data on the Zomato Pune website.

This repo contains all the analysis I have done on the dataset given by the **PISB DataWiz Team** for the second task of **DataWiz 2k21**.
For this task, we had to implement at least 5 unique types of data visualisations, based on whatever correlations we felt are apt.

## Important
**Sometimes Github has trouble rendering .ipynb files.**

## General Procedure to follow:
1) Perform data preparation & cleaning
   - Handle missing, incorrect and invalid data (if any)
   - Perform any additional steps (creating additional columns, merging multiple columns etc. if needed)

2) Perform exploratory analysis & visualization
   - Compute the mean, sum, range and other interesting statistics for numeric columns
   - Explore distributions of numeric columns using histograms etc.
   - Explore relationship between columns using scatter plots, bar charts etc.
   - Make a note of interesting insights from the exploratory analysis

3) Ask & answer questions about the data
   - Ask at least 5 interesting questions about the dataset
   - Answer the questions either by computing the results using Numpy/Pandas or by plotting graphs using Matplotlib/Seaborn

4) Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion
   - Write a summary of what you've learned from the analysis
   - Include interesting insights and graphs from previous sections
